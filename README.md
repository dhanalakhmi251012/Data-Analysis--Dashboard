# Russia - Ukraine War Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
"I developed a Power BI project titled 'Russia-Ukraine War Analysis Dashboard' that analyzes the war's impact on civilians, military casualties, and weapon losses. It highlights economic effects on markets, trade, and inflation, as well as infrastructure damage . Data is categorized by country, year, and city for an interactive view".
## Project Overview
The project “Russia-Ukraine War Analysis Data Dashboard with Power BI” is provides visual representation by Power Bi for people and world leaders not to make such a decision.

The primary goal of this project is to provide an in-depth 
analysis of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war through interactive and visually engaging power Bi dashboards.

By leveraging Power BI, the project aims to present critical insights into key aspects of the conflict, such as geopolitical impacts, humanitarian consequences, and economic effects.

By combining multiple datasets and presenting them through interactive visual representation , it supports transparency, awareness, and decision-making for world leaders.
